# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
This was the Capstone Project of a 3 month long program at IIT Guwahati where we learned about various data science techniques.
The IPYNB file shows the various EDA I did as well as data preprocessing for the prediction.

## Features

The various features in the dataset are

***

There are no missing values

And the dataset is balanced

Plotted the distributions of the some the features

***

Before applying the models, I checked the importances of the features using Extra Tree Classifier

***

Used RandomizedSearchCV on Logistic Regression which gave an accuracy of 79.37% and SVC gave an accuracy of 80.3%
